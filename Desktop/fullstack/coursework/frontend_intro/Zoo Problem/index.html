      There are eight different species of bears across the world with a
      conservation status ranging from vulnerable to least concern. Depending on
      the bear species, habitats include North America, South America, Europe,
      Asia, and the northern-most polar regions. While not ordinarily a threat
      to humans, bears are animals that can be very dangerous if startled,
      provoked, or approached when young bears (cubs) are present.

      The Giraffe is the tallest living animal on land and despite its height is
      most closely related to the much smaller and solitary Okapi, which is
      found elusively dwelling in dense tropical forests. There are nine
      recognized subspecies of giraffes that are found in differing geographic
      locations and vary somewhat in the color and pattern of their spot-like
      markings. Although the Giraffes would have once been found across
      sub-Saharan Africa and even in parts of North Africa, today they are
      extinct from much of their historically vast natural range with only
      small, isolated populations remaining in a handful of regions in central
      Africa. Further south, however, Giraffe populations are considered to be
      stable and are even growing in some areas due to an increase in demand for
      them on private ranches.

      The lion is one of the largest, strongest, and most powerful felines in
      the world, second only in size to the Siberian Tiger. They are the largest
      cats on the African continent. While most big cats are solitary hunters,
      lions are incredibly sociable animals that live together in family groups
      called pride.

      Monkeys are primates that comprise a wide range of species throughout much
      of the tropical world. Despite their raw variety, most of them face
      threats from human development, capture, and hunting. Though all monkeys
      have many similar characteristics and a close relationship to humans, an
      early evolutionary shift created two major groups today: “old” and “new”
      world monkeys. Though they do not walk on two legs, monkeys are closely
      related to humans, only great apes, such as chimpanzees, are more related.
      Monkeys are some of the most popular animals in the world.

      Alligators are in the same family as other large reptiles like Crocodiles
      but are native to only two countries, which are the southern USA and China
      (where the Alligator is now nearly extinct). Alligators tend to be smaller
      than their Crocodile cousins but have been known to move at speeds of up
      to 15mph on land making them one of the fastest large reptiles in the
      world. Despite their size, there are a number of distinct differences
      between Alligators and Crocodiles as an Alligators snout is shorter than
      that of a Crocodile, and with their mouths shut, an Alligators teeth
      cannot be seen but a Crocodiles can. Alligators are also commonly known as
      Gators in their native, southern North American habitats.
